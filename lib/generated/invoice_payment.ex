  @moduledoc "Invoice Payments represent payments made against invoices. Invoice Payments can\nbe accessed in two ways:\n1. By expanding the `payments` field on the [Invoice](https://stripe.com/docs/api#invoice) resource.\n2. By using the Invoice Payment retrieve and list endpoints.\n\nInvoice Payments include the mapping between payment objects, such as Payment Intent, and Invoices.\nThis resource and its endpoints allows you to easily track if a payment is associated with a specific invoice and\nmonitor the allocation details of the payments."
